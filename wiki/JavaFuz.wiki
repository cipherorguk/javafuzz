{{{NAME
     JavaFuzz - Java Class Fuzzer 

SYNOPSIS
     JavaFuzz.jar [-v] -c class [-e type] [-l StringLength]...

DESCRIPTION
     JavaFuzz is a java classes fuzzer based on the the Java Reflection
     API. The reflection API represents, or reflects, the classes, interfaces, 
     and objects in the current Java Virtual Machine. Using the reflection 
     API JavaFuzz can contruct and invoke any given class (or list of classes).
     After getting the types that a class accepts will construct the classes using
     large values. 
     

OPTIONS
     -v   Verbose - Fully Print Exceptions. Very usuafull and you better use 
     	  that if you want to spot any weird exceptions.

     -c   Classname
          Input is Class name e.g java.net.URL , you cannot use -f at the same 
          time. 

     -f   Read Class names from a file. Classnames should be on in each line.

     -s   You can set the start of the fuzzing String, for example "http://" or 
          "/home/test/" and so on ..

     -e   You can set the type you want to overflow with the MAX_VALUE on top
	      for example if you want to pass twice the size of a double to a class 
	      which is defined to accept only double you do "-e double"
	      Warning: If you do that with an integer it will overflow  and 
	      become -2.
	      Values can be : int, double, float, long, short. 

	 -r   Number of recursions until constructs the class [Default 20]
		  If needs more it will set type to null and consider it Infinite.
		  Usually when trying to construct types that dont get any arguments 
		  it will be fine, if it  will try to construct classes that their
		  types accept arguments and so on... JavaFuzz will keep constructing 
		  types until it gets the asked types. 
	 	 
	 -a   Set size of used array when fuzzing  [Default 100000]
	      This option can be maximum Integer.MAX_VALUE
     
	 -l   Set length of used Strings when fuzzing [Default 1024]
	      This option can be maximum Integer.MAX_VALUE
	         

BUGS
     It cannot construct classes with types : 
     a) Array of an array of something 
     b) Array that is not int,double,float,short,long,string
