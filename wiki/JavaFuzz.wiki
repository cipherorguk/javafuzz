NAME
     JavaFuzz - Java Class Fuzzer 

SYNOPSIS
     JavaFuzz.jar [-v] -c class [-e type] [-l StringLength]...

DESCRIPTION
     JavaFuzz is a java classes fuzzer based on the the Java Reflection
     API. The reflection API represents, or reflects, the classes, interfaces, 
     and objects in the current Java Virtual Machine. Using the reflection 
     API JavaFuzz can contruct and invoke any given class (or list of classes).
     After getting the types that a class accepts will construct the classes using
     large values. 
     

OPTIONS
     -v   Verbose - Fully Print Exceptions. Very usuafull and you better use 
     	  that if you want to spot any weird exceptions.

     -m   Fuzz methods of a Class, Can take Long time to finish

     -c   Classname
          Input is Class name e.g java.net.URL , you cannot use -f at the same 
          time. 

     -f   Read Class names from a file. Classnames should be on in each line.

     -s   You can set the fuzzing String, for example "http://www.example.com" or 
          "/home/test/" and so on ..

     -e   You can set the type you want to overflow with the MAX_VALUE on top
          for example if you want to pass twice the size of a double to a class 
	  which is defined to accept only double you do "-e double"
	  Warning: If you do that with an integer it will overflow  and 
	  become -2.
	  Values can be : int, double, float, long, short. 

     -r   Number of recursions until constructs the class [Default 20]
	  If needs more it will set type to null and consider it Infinite.
	  Usually when trying to construct types that dont get any arguments 
	  it will be fine, if it  will try to construct classes that their
	  types accept arguments and so on... JavaFuzz will keep constructing 
	  types until it gets the asked types. 
	 	 
     -a   Set size of used array when fuzzing  [Default 800]
          This option can be maximum Integer.MAX_VALUE
     
     -l   Set length of used Strings when fuzzing [Default 1024]
          This option can be maximum Integer.MAX_VALUE

EXAMPLES

	 java -jar JavaFuzz.jar -c java.lang.String -v
	 java -jar JavaFuzz.jar -f classes.txt -v -e int
	 java -jar JavaFuzz.jar -c java.net.URL -e int -s http://www.example.com	         

BUGS
         It cannot construct classes with types : 
         a) Multidimensional array that is not int,double,float,short,long,string
         b) Array that is not int,double,float,short,long,string
