# javafuzz

JavaFuzz is a java classes fuzzer based on the the Java Reflection API. The reflection API represents, or reflects, the classes, interfaces, and objects in the current Java Virtual Machine. Using the reflection API it can contruct and invoke any given class (or list of classes). After getting the types that a class accepts will construct the class using expected and/or inappropriate values. If the option -m is issued then all the methods will be invoked as well. Have look in the Examples article.

Note : Check the subversion repository for the latest version, Downloads get the latest packaged version, not the latest available version. For example the latest code base has a fix for the variable position brute forcing option.
